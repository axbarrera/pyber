# Total rides are mainly urban, at 68% of total.
# Total fares are also urban, at 62% of total.
# Urban makes up 80% of total drivers, showing a surplus of drivers in urban areas relative to rides by area.
# An interesting call-out - rural fares make up 6.8% of total fares, however there is a seeming shortage of drivers, at only 2.6% being rural by area. This could show a disproportionately high fare per ride because of the driver shortage in rural areas, or a signal for higher demand than is currently provided for in rural areas.
